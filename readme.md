Pretty much ever since I ventured into the FS AI scene, I wished for a tool that could visualize my flightplans. I randomly made some suggestions to tool developers, but nothing ever materialized. Recently I remembered this and figured a simple version of just that shouldn't be too hard to realise (with the few programming skills I have, which are pretty much limited to web development).

Long story short&hellip;ish: I present the TFS Routemapizer (beta, of course). It basically works like this: you paste your AI flightplans into a text box, hit that fancy button, some behind the scenes magic happens, and a GCMap Google Maps map with the routes in your FPs pops up. It's something to play around with, nothing too fancy, nothing too useful, but I still kinda like it.

There are plans for other future features, like letting the user put it the routes directly (i.e. EHAM-KJFK-SKBO instead of an AI flightplan), but that will take some time (which is rather rare these days). If you have any suggestions, wishes or bugs to report don't hesitate to contact us.
